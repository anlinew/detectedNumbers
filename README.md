# detectedNumbers

University project of a course Mobile Systems Engineering at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.

Playground for embedded systems. As the base I used a face detection demo app from the OpenCV computer vision library API for Android.

Main part was to set up the Arduino microcontroller:

a) Build a working 7 segment led screen on Arduino board;
b) Connect it to the Android smartphone using an Arduino Bluetooth module;
c) Develop a getter - setter on the app and Arduino sides.

Show number of detected faces (using OpenCV) in a 7 segment led screen on Arduino microcontroller.
